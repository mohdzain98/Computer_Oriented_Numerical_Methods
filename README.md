# Numerical-Integration
Numerical Integration is done by using Trapezoidal rule,Simpson 1/3 rule, Simpson 3/8 rule and Guass Quadrature.</br>
In this we will also see the error i.e. the difference between the actual integrate value and the approximate value calculated by any of the rule.<br>
A function we are taking is integral with limit 0 to 1 underroot(1+4x^2)*sin(x) <br>
And function for Guass Quadrature is integral with limit 2 to 4 underroot(1+x^2)*exponent to the power(-x) where x=mt+c where m=(b-a)/2 and c=(b+a)/2.
